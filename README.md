wrong please let me know. As I am new any help would be greatly appreciated.

Teacher Practice App
######################
I build this app as an intro to angularjs and phonegap. The app was to help my wife study for her MTTC test.
I have a database of questions I have found on the internet with answers that should be correct (again I found them on the 
internet) and the application uses this data which is currently in a JSON file to ask the user and tell them if they are 
correct in their answer. Currently it save everything in cache on the phone or whatever you compile it in with Phonegap.

Thanks for taking a look, if you are interested in the project or have questions please feel free to message me or contact
me... not sure how this is all done on github as this is my first day using it.
